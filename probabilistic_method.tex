\chapter{Probabilistic Method}

The idea behind the probabilistic method is to show that a certain
type of structure exists by defining a probability space of structures
and showing that the desired properties hold with positive
probability.

For example, we can show that any graph has a bipartite subgraph of
size $\frac{e}{2}$ by iterating over the vertices and randomly
assigning each to a set $A$ or $B$.  Since each edge is equally likely
to be from one set to itself or one set to the other, the expected
number of edges from $A$ to $B$ is $\frac{e}{2}$ and therefore there
must always exist a bipartite subgraph with at least as many edges.

Historical note: Paul Erd\H{o}s developed the probabilistic method.
